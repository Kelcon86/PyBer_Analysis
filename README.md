# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, has asked that all of the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 be analyzed and that visualizations be created to display the data. 

## Results
The data from our city_data and ride_data CSV's were combined to create a single dataset. Using the GroupBy function I got a count of the total rides and drivers for each city type, the total amount of fares for each city type and the average fare per ride and per driver for each city type. The results can be seen in the graph below.
